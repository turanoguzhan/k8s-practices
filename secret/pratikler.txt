S-1 > Team Neptune has its own ServiceAccount named neptune-sa-v2 in Namespace neptune. A coworker needs the token from the Secret that belongs to that ServiceAccount. Write the base64 decoded token to file /opt/course/5/token.
C-1 > Since K8s 1.24, Secrets won't be created automatically for ServiceAccounts any longer. But it's still possible to create a Secret manually and attach it to a ServiceAccount by setting the correct annotation on the Secret. This was done for this task.
k -n neptune get sa # get overview
k -n neptune get secrets # shows all secrets of namespace
k -n neptune get secrets -oyaml | grep annotations -A 1 # shows secrets with first annotation
# if a Secret belongs to a ServiceAccont, it'll have the annotation kubernetes.io/service-account.name. Here the Secret we're looking for is neptune-secret-1.

k -n neptune get secret neptune-secret-1 -o yaml 

copy data into another file and then

cat file_path | base64 --decoded
