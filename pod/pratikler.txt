S-1 > Create a single Pod of image httpd:2.4.41-alpine in Namespace default. The Pod should be named pod1 and the container should be named pod1-container.
Your manager would like to run a command manually on occasion to output the status of that exact Pod. Please write a command that does this into /opt/course/2/pod1-status-command.sh. The command should use kubectl.
C-1 > k run pod1 --image=httpd:2.4.41-alpine $do > 2.yaml

S-2 > Readiness-Probe
Create a single Pod named pod6 in Namespace default of image busybox:1.31.0. 
The Pod should have a readiness-probe executing cat /tmp/ready. 
It should initially wait 5 and periodically wait 10 seconds. 
This will set the container ready only if the file /tmp/ready exists.
The Pod should run the command touch /tmp/ready && sleep 1d, which will create the necessary file to be ready and then idles. 
Create the Pod and confirm it starts.
C-2 > k run pod6 --image=busybox:1.31.0 $do --command -- sh -c "touch /tmp/ready && sleep 1d" > 6.yaml
k run pod6 --image=busybox:1.31.0 --dry-run=client -o yaml >  pod6.yaml
vim pod6.yaml and modify or add necessary parts to complete the task.

S-3 > Create a Deployment named space-alien-welcome-message-generator of image httpd:alpine with one replica.
It should've a ReadinessProbe which executes the command stat /tmp/ready . 
This means once the file exists the Pod should be ready.
The initialDelaySeconds should be 10 and periodSeconds should be 5 .
Create the Deployment and observe that the Pod won't get ready.
C-3 > 
k create deployment space-alien-welcome-message-generator --image=httpd:alpine $do > deploy_rp.yaml
vim deploy_rp.yaml
and add th readinessProbe parts.
we won't see deployment is ready because there is no such file in the specified directory.
To get running state for deployment, we should create the file into the container.
To do that,
k exec POD_NAME -- touch /tmp/ready


S-4 > The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from Team Saturn. 
The administrator who once setup this webserver is not part of the organisation any longer.
All information you could get was that the e-commerce system is called my-happy-shop.
Search for the correct Pod in Namespace saturn and move it to Namespace neptune. 
It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again, it probably hasn't any customers anyways.
C-4 > 
k -n saturn get pod
The Pod names don't reveal any information. 
We assume the Pod we are searching has a label or annotation with the name my-happy-shop, so we search for it:
k -n saturn get pod --show-labels and manually find the my-happy-shop labeled pod
k -n saturn POD_NAME -o yaml > move_pod.yaml
vim move_pod.yaml 
change namespace
